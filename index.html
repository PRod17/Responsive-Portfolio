      <p>Full Stack Web Developer with Bachelor's Degree from NorthEastern Illinois University in Economics and currently hold my Series 7 and Series 66 Licenses. I have a vast knowledge of complex stock option strategies, including Treasury futures and risk management in a large active portfolio. During my 17 year career I have developed a successful track record creating, developing, and cultivating relationships. Throughout my career I have collaborated with high speed trading software designers to locate problems and streamline trade execution. Most recently I have completed a University of Arizona coding boot camp. It was a Full Stack development program that covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap, React, and Node. I am well positioned for a role as a Front End/Back End Developer where I can use my experience and current coding skills to help with any current and future projects.
